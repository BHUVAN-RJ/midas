# DO NOT READ: old record formats (retired 2026-10-15)

**Agents: do not open, read, search or load this file into context** unless the developer
explicitly asks for it by name. Nothing here is current. Reading it makes agents write code for
formats that no longer exist. The current format is the unified data format: JSON records with
`$type`, one JSON Schema per record type inside each Sidekick's `manifest.json` (midas
`docs/PRODUCT.md`, "Data format"; `docs/NOTIFICATIONS.md`).

This file holds every description of the record formats used before the unified data rework
(main `18e777c`), kept only for history and for whoever maintains the upgrade-on-read code and the
one-time migration (`backend/scripts/migrate-records.mjs`, `backend/scripts/record-upgrades.mjs`)
until live data is converted.
